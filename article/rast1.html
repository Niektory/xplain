        <h3>Widening the horizon</h3>
        <p>
            While this article series is named "Xplain", and while I try to focus on concepts related to the
            X11 window system and its architecture, I often want to write about other topics, ones that are
            related, but maybe a bit more general than just X11-specific. The Regions article was an example
            of that. Today, I'm going to talk about basic software rasterization of 2D graphics. While not
            an X11-specific concept, I feel it will be interesting to the same audience, and I'll include it
            in the Xplain series. Going forward, Xplain will probably not be just about X11.
        </p>

        <p>
            Something I have been interested in for quite some time, and something I feel is not very
            widely understood, are the basics of 2D graphics and 2D graphics rasterization. I often see
            comments like "oh, if only SVG was implemented with WebGL, then it would be fast", and realize
            that people do not quite understand the challenges and complications of 2D graphics rendering.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, we will be exploring 2D graphics by writing a software rasterizer of our own. All of the
            code was written for this article, and is open source on the GitHub repo. I've tried to comment
            it well as a source to learn from. I encourage you to study it.

        <h3>The Pixel Grid</h3>
        <p>
            The X11 articles take place in a hand-written X11 server. Regional Geometry took place, well,
            in the land of geometry. Today's article takes place...
        </p> 

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast1-grid-demo"></div>

        <p>
            ... on the pixel grid. By the end of this article series, hopefully you will be able
            to, if not write something of this complexity, at least understand what is going on and how
            it works.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've magnified each pixel so it is easier to see. Specifically, each "demo pixel" here
            is 8 "real pixels" wide, and the same tall. The grid itself is composed of 128 of these
            "demo pixels" horizontally, and 64 of them vertically.
        </p>
        <p>
            It might hurt your head to think about "demo pixels" and "real pixels". Graphics programming
            often takes place in lots of different "spaces" like this. After quite a long time of doing it,
            I still get confused; it's just part of the job description. If you are having trouble, what
            helps me is to just turn off the monitor, grab a pen and paper, or a whiteboard, and just draw
            the different things out.
        </p>
        <p>
            When your head hurts for far too long and you start getting confused, you will just start
            peppering <code>x*8</code> and <code>(y+15)/8</code> into your code in a vain attempt to just
            get everything to match up correctly. You will start fiddling with your plus and minus signs,
            wildly reversing your translations and rotations at random in a desperate attempt to get
            things to just line up, dammit. It is not a good place to be.

        <h3>Coordinates</h3>
        <p>
            While I'm sure everyone here doesn't need a refresher, let's over some notation and basic math
            for how to address pixels in this grid. We often treat pixel buffers as large arrays in memory,
            and we usually leave them one-dimensional, and do the math ourselves to find a specific index
            for a given position.
        </p>
        <p>
            Buffer layouts in the real world have a lot of subtleties &mdash; whether that's stride alignment,
            endianness issues or pixel formats. If you don't know what any of those things are, don't worry,
            I'll talk about them later. In this article series, we'll be using the convention established by
            HTML5's <a class="code-literal" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData">ImageData</a>
            API. We see this pixel grid as a giant, one-dimensional array of bytes, with each pixel taking four
            bytes: red, green, blue, alpha, in that order.
        </p>

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast1-imagedata-pixel-format"></div>

        <p>
            We can find the index of the first byte of a pixel, and vice versa, with some very simple math:
        </p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var BYTES_PER_PIXEL = 4;

function indexForPixelLocation(imageData, x, y) {
    return (y * imageData.width + x) * BYTES_PER_PIXEL;   
}

function pixelLocationForIndex(imageData, idx) {
    var pixelIdx = Math.floor(idx / BYTES_PER_PIXEL);
    var y = Math.floor(pixelIdx / imageData.width);
    var x = pixelIdx % imageData.width;
    return { x: x, y: y };
}
</code></pre>

        <p>
            Familiarize yourselves with what these functions do &mdash; they convert from the x and y
            coordinates of pixels on the grid to their index into the array of pixels. Pixels go from
            top left to bottom right, first in the X direction, then in the Y direction. The top left of
            the pixel grid is at <span class="definition">0, 0</span> at index 0. The next pixel in the
            array, which starts at index 4, is located directly to the right.
        </p>

        <section id="draw-rectangle">
        <h3>Let's Draw a Rectangle</h3>
        <p>
            Now that we've established ourselves with the format of the pixel grid, let's try drawing
            a rectangle. For simplicity's sake, let's just fill it with black for now.
        </p>

<pre><code class="javascript">function fillPixel(imageData, x, y) {
    var idx = indexForPixelLocation(imageData, x, y);
    imageData.data[idx + 0] = 0; // Red
    imageData.data[idx + 1] = 0; // Green
    imageData.data[idx + 2] = 0; // Blue
    imageData.data[idx + 3] = 255; // Alpha
}

function fillRectangle(imageData, x1, y1, width, height) {
    for (var y = y1; y < y1 + height; y++)
        for (var x = x1; x < x1 + width; x++)
            fillPixel(imageData, x, y);
}
</code></pre>

        <p>
            And let's try it out.
        </p>

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast1-fillrect-basic"></div>

        <p>
            This should be pretty straightforward, but there are a few pecularities I do want to go over.
            First, it may strike some of you as odd to iterate over the "y" first. It does not make any
            difference in this case, but graphics programmers often think about things in rows.
            This is a holdover from early computer graphics, and it's for performance reasons &mdash;
            if you think about the memory layout of our pixel grid, you'll notice that I'm iterating over the
            indexes in order. While RAM does stand for "random access memory", CPUs cheat and have things
            called "caches". Just know that it is cheaper to write to indexes in order than it is to jump
            around at random.
        </p>
        <p>
            While it does not matter too much in our example, you should be aware that iterating over the
            rows of a pixel grid first is common convention. This will become more apparent when we start
            going over more complex topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should also hopefully be pretty clear how to replace this "black" with another color, so I
            won't bother explaining that. I will, however, up the ante. Let's try filling this rectangle
            with some gradients.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="gradients">
        <h3>Space and Time</h3>
        <p>
            It might not seem related, but I'm going to try to explain gradients by first trying to animate
            this rectangle through time, and I'm going to do it with a technique called
            <span class="definition">linear interpolation</span>. A linear interpolation, or a
            <span class="definition">lerp</span>, lets us transition between two values. The position in this
            transition is often called <span class="definition">time</span>, variable
            name <span class="code-literal">t</span>, and is a value between 0 and 1, which tells us which of the
            two values we should be "closer to". Let's use a "lerp" here to animate the rectangle
            across the grid.
        </p>

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast1-fillrect-lerp"></div>
<pre><code class="javascript">function lerp(a, b, t) {
    return (a * (1.0 - t)) + (b * t);
}

function draw(imageData, secs) {
    var startX = 1;
    var endX = 38;
    var x = Math.floor(lerp(startX, endX, secs));
    var y = 1;
    fillRectangle(imageData, x, y, 8, 8);
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
            The lerp is actually a really simple and cool piece of math that can be used in a lot of
            different scenarios. I won't go into a full description,
            since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">Wikipedia already has you
            mostly covered</a>, but I will show you a somewhat cool thing you can do here. The last
            parameter, "t", is a value between 0 and 1. In this case, we derive it from how many seconds have
            passed in the animation, but we can warp it a bit. We can do the obvious scaling, but we can also
            use more complicated warping. For instance, to make it slow down near the end, we can warp "t" by
            passing it through a famous easing curve known
            as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep">smoothstep</a>":
        </p>

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast1-fillrect-lerp-smoothstep"></div>
<pre><code class="javascript">function lerp(a, b, t) {
    return (a * (1.0 - t)) + (b * t);
}

function smoothstep(t) {
    return t*t*(3 - t*2);
}

function draw(imageData, secs) {
    var startX = 1;
    var endX = 38;
    var smoothSecs = smoothstep(secs);
    var x = Math.floor(lerp(startX, endX, smoothSecs));
    var y = 1;
    fillRectangle(imageData, x, y, 8, 8);
}
</code></pre>

        <p>
            ... which looks a bit easier on the eyes. Even though "t" stems from the word "time", as in the
            math-y "f(t)" sense of the word, it's important to realize that we can use it for more than just
            time, and we can lerp more than just the rectangle's position. For instance, we can lerp between
            two colors with just a bit more code.
        </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">function newRGB(r, g, b) {
    return { r: r, g: g, b: b };
}

function lerpRGB(color1, color2, t) {
    var newR = lerp(color1.r, color2.r, t);
    var newG = lerp(color1.g, color2.g, t);
    var newB = lerp(color1.b, color2.b, t);
    return newRGB(newR, newG, newB);
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
            This isn't doing anything more fancy than just doing a lerp across all three components in a
            color, and if we draw a ton of 1px-wide rectangles that all use this:
        </p>

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast1-lerp-gradient"></div>
<pre><code class="javascript">function fillPixel(imageData, x, y, rgb) {
    var idx = indexForPixelLocation(imageData, x, y);
    imageData.data[idx + 0] = rgb.r;
    imageData.data[idx + 1] = rgb.g;
    imageData.data[idx + 2] = rgb.b;
    imageData.data[idx + 3] = 255; // Alpha
}

function fillRectangle(imageData, rgb, x1, y1, width, height) {
    for (var y = y1; y < y1 + height; y++)
        for (var x = x1; x < x1 + width; x++)
            fillPixel(imageData, x, y, rgb);
}

function draw(imageData) {
    var startX = 1;
    var endX = BUFFER_WIDTH - 1;

    var red = newRGB(255, 0, 0);
    var blue = newRGB(0, 0, 255);
    for (var x = startX; x < endX; x++) {
        var t = (x - startX) / (endX - startX);
        var rgb = lerpRGB(red, blue, t);
        fillRectangle(imageData, rgb, x, 1, 1, BUFFER_HEIGHT - 2);
    }
}
</code></pre>

        <h3>Styling our Rectangle</h3>
        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast1-gradients"></div>

        <p>
            A gradient allows us to fill a shape with more than one color, by blending a bunch of different
            colors together. The simplest gradient is the Radial gradient, which makes a "ball" of colors.
            A simple radial gradient has four properties: a center position from where the ball will expand
            from, the color at that center position, a radius which tells us where the ball stops, and the
            color at that radius.  
        </p>
        <p>
            For each pixel in our rectangle, we can compute its distance to the center point, and that tells
            us how much of each color to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our updated code here looks like:
        </p>

<pre><code class="javascript">function newRGB(r, g, b) {
    return { r: r, g: g, b: b };
}

// Mix colors "color1" and "color2" together at time value "t",
// where 0 is "color1" and 1 is "color2".
function mixRGB(color1, color2, t) {
    var newR = (color1.r * (1.0 - t)) + (color2.r * t);
    var newG = (color1.g * (1.0 - t)) + (color2.g * t);
    var newB = (color1.b * (1.0 - t)) + (color2.b * t);
    return newRGB(newR, newG, newB);
}

function newRadialGradient(centerX, centerY, radius, centerRGB, edgeRGB) {
    return function(x, y) {
        // Calculate distance from the center point.
        var distX = x - centerX, distY = y - centerY;
        var distance = Math.sqrt(distX*distX + distY*distY);

        // If we're outside the circle, then just return the color at the edge.
        // This is a choice -- we could instead choose to repeat or ping-pong
        // between the colors.
        if (distance >= radius)
            return edgeRGB;

        // Translate the [0, radius] ranged value to a [0, 1] ranged value
        // so we can mix the colors.
        var t = distance / radius;
        return mixRGB(centerRGB, edgeRGB, t);
    };
}

// The same code as above, but slightly adapted to handle fill styles
// and custom colors.

function fillPixel(imageData, x, y, rgb) {
    var idx = indexForPixelLocation(imageData, x, y);
    imageData.data[idx + 0] = rgb.r;
    imageData.data[idx + 1] = rgb.g;
    imageData.data[idx + 2] = rgb.b;
    imageData.data[idx + 3] = 255; // Alpha
}

function fillRectangle(imageData, fillStyle, x1, y1, width, height) {
    for (var y = y1; y < y1 + height; y++) {
        for (var x = x1; x < x1 + width; x++) {
            var rgb = fillStyle(x, y);
            fillPixel(imageData, x, y, rgb);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
            OK. There's a lot in here to go through. First off, let's go over our method of representing
            colors. Much like <span class="code-literal">ImageData</span>, we use values spanning from 0
            to 255 to represent each channel, and I put these values in an object with "r", "g", and "b"
            slots. We also need the ability to <a href="https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/html/mix.xhtml">mix</a>
            between two colors, which gives us a nice smooth transition. We can easily do this by
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">linear interpolating</a> each of
            the two colors.
        </p>
        <p>
            After we have this ability to mix, or lerp, between two different colors, the rest of the
            algorithm is dedicated to figuring out which time "t" we should be using. In the case of a radial
            gradient, it's actually just the distance from the center point, normalized against the radius.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an exercise, try working out, using this base, how to have arbitrary gradient stops at different
            time values, rather than just two colors at the starts and ends.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="circles">
        <h3>Drawing Other Shapes</h3>
        <p>
            Now that we've become familiarized with the concepts of rendering boxes and fills, let's try our
            hand at something a tad bit more fancy &mdash; rendering other shapes. To start with, we'll actually
            just draw the shape we just taught ourselves how to draw above: circles. We just learned above how
            to calculate the time "t" of a point x,y against any circle, and you can visualize that a real circle
            is simply a bunch of those points where we're inside the radius. So we can just run over our pixel
            grid, test when we're "inside" the circle, and if so, choose to fill in the pixel.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only complication here is that we have to pick some start and end bounds for where we start
            iterating. We could use our <em>entire</em> pixel grid, but we know a bunch of pixels will never be
            filled in. We need a tight set of pixels. Thankfully, for a circle, it's quite easy to compute: it has
            a width of twice the radius, and "pokes out" to the left an amount of the radius.
        </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">function fillCircle(imageData, fillStyle, centerX, centerY, radius) {
    var x1 = centerX - radius, y1 = centerY - radius;
    var x2 = centerX + radius, y2 = centerY + radius;
    for (var y = y1; y < y2; y++) {
        for (var x = x1; x < x2; x++) {
            var distX = (x - centerX), distY = (y - centerY);
            var distance = Math.sqrt(distX*distX + distY*distY);
            if (distance <= radius) {
                var rgb = fillStyle(x, y);
                fillPixel(imageData, x, y, rgb);
            }
        }
    }
}

        <p>
            Oof. What happened here? This doesn't look very... circular. At this point, it might be tempting
            to just try to brute force your way through the code: changing the <span class="code-literal">&lt;=</span>
            above to a single <span class="code-literal">&lt;</span>, adding various <span class="code-literal">+ 1</span>
            and <span class="code-literal">-1</span>s throughout.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is actually nothing wrong with the above code in the abstract. The issue here is actually a
            fundamental and conceptual one. You might also have spotted it above in the radial gradient example:
            the gradient isn't centered, it's sort of down and to the right. These are both related problems.

        <h3>Sample Location</h3>
        <p>
            When we do something like the above when we draw &mdash; iterate over a bunch of pixels, and then test
            whether a pixel should be in or out, we're making use of a concept known as <span class="definition">sampling</span>.
            Basically, we have some functional concept of a shape, like a circle, and we can give it different x and y
            values and it tells us whether they are inside or outside of the circle. But what do these points mean?

            Well, I mean, we know that in our pixel grid, each one of these numbers corresponds to a pixel. But what
            about the <em>abstract space</em> where these circle descriptions live? We're talking about a circle
            centered at, let's say, 5, 5, with a radius of 10. We have to have some concept of mapping this abstract
            space to the pixel grid. Up until now, we haven't thought about this and have been hacking it together
            based on what makes sense. But we need to establish what this looks like.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm going to cheat, and for my next figure, show you what this abstract space circle looks like, laid on
            top of the pixel grid.

            Maybe the revelation is clear now about what's actually going on. If not, don't worry. Right now, when
            we test each pixel against the abstract space circle, we've been testing whether the <em>top left</em>
            of the square is inside the abstract circle. When you think about it, that doesn't quite make sense.
            Really, what our sampling method is trying to ask is "is more than 50% of the square inside the circle".
            Using something smarter like the pixel's center would make more sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can do this by adjusting our <span class="code-literal">fillCircle</span> function to test distance
            against the pixel's <em>center</em> in the abstract space. Since pixel centers are halfway between pixels,
            all we need to do is add <span class="code-literal">0.5</span> to both dimensions before calculating the
            distance.
        </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">function fillCircle(imageData, fillStyle, centerX, centerY, radius) {
    var x1 = centerX - radius, y1 = centerY - radius;
    var x2 = centerX + radius, y2 = centerY + radius;
    for (var y = y1; y < y2; y++) {
        for (var x = x1; x < x2; x++) {
            var distX = (x - centerX<strong> + 0.5</strong>), distY = (y - centerY<strong> + 0.5</strong>);
            var distance = Math.sqrt(distX*distX + distY*distY);
            if (distance <= radius) {
                var rgb = fillStyle(x, y);
                fillPixel(imageData, x, y, rgb);
            }
        }
    }
}

            Ah, there we go. This also explains the bizarre gradient bug we were seeing earlier. When we were comparing
            distances in the gradients, we were also comparing distances with the top left of the pixel, rather than
            the pixel's center. I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to fix that one.
